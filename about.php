    	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <strong>How many hours do I need, and how do I earn them?</strong>
        <p>Check your <a href="dashboard">Dashboard </a>for information about how many points you need to maintain membership in Beta. As a general rule, each member is required to earn 25 service hours per year, 12.5 hours of which MUST be obtained by doing Beta related projects (this number differs slightly based on your grade level). You can earn these by volunteering, doing service that doesn't give you a profit, or by helping out with the projects that Beta Club sponsors. Beta members can also earn points with attendance at all the meetings (0.5pts per meeting), teacher help (up to 2pts*), and item donations (up to 3pts*).</p>
        <strong>How do I sign up for projects? </strong>
        <p>Go the the <a href="events">Volunteer</a> page. Choose any project you would like to help out with and choose the shifts you are available to work. Answer any additional questions and click "Volunteer!" Any event on our website or mentioned at our meetings are Beta sponsored events and count towards your Beta point requirement.</p>
        <strong>How do I keep track of my service hours?</strong>
        <p>Your <a href="dashboard">Dashboard </a>will have information about how many points you have earned along with how many points you need to maintain membership in Beta. Please get your community service log signed at the end of each event you volunteer at to keep track of all your points. You may print a blank <a href="resources/community_service_log.pdf" target="_blank">Community Service Log </a>here or pick one up at the counseling office. We update your points on the website at the end of each semester when you turn in a copy of your service log.</p>
        <strong>What happens if I miss a meeting? </strong>
        <p>Meetings are held on the first Tuesday of every month at 6:40am and 2:25pm in various locations you can find on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ngbetaclub/">Instagram</a>. Attendance will be taken at every meeting, as meetings are necessary in order for members to be up-to-date on all upcoming service projects and events. Additionally, members will earn 0.5 points per meeting they attend, which will be counted as part of their 10 Beta related hours. Morning meetings and afternoon meeting make up .5 points each, and the service project (which is held directly after every after-school meeting) is worth 1 point.</p>
        <strong>What happens if I can no longer volunteer for an event I registered for, or I miss a project that I signed up for?</strong>
        <p>If you have a valid excuse, please e-mail the project leader at least 2 days in advance and cancel your signup on the website (find the event you voluntered for and click "Cancel My Signup"). Turn in emergency excuses no later than one week after the project.</p>

    	<h2 style="text-align:center;">General Information</h2>
        <p>The North Gwinnett Beta Club is the largest student organization on campus, made up of the best and brightest students North Gwinnett has to offer. Membership is based on student's cumulative grade percent average. To be a member of the Beta Club, students must attain and maintain a 90.0% average or higher.</p>
        <p>The North Gwinnett Beta Club is a chapter of the National Beta Club Organization. The National Beta Club began as the dream of its founder, Dr. John W. Harris, a professor at Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC. Since the first Beta Club was formed in Landrum, SC in 1934, The National Beta Club has become the nation's largest independent, non-profit, educational youth organization. We are committed to recognizing and promoting high academic achievement, rewarding and nurturing worthy character, fostering leadership skills and encouraging service to others. <!-- p-->
        </p><p>There was a Beta Club before there was a North Gwinnett High School! The NGHS Beta Club was chartered in 1948 at the former Sugar Hill High School. Beta is not only the largest organization on campus but also the oldest!</p>
        <p>In past years, NGHS Beta Alums have been granted acceptance to the nation's most prestigious universities: Duke, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, University of North Caroline, Florida State, University of Miami, Emory, Brown, and of course Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia (just to name a few).</p>
        <p>Beta members care about their school, local community, and the global community. Each year Beta participates in various service projects ranging from the annual "Haunted House" event, to competing in Convention, being involved in Beta Week, and to raising money for local charities with our annual Walk-a-thon and Car Wash.</p>
        <p>Beta gives students the opportunity to build leadership skills. In additional to the executive council, many projects require team captains to help with planning and execution stages of service projects. Also, many scholarships are offered through National Beta Club and last year, few of our very own students won! Finally, at graduation, members will walk with honor with a cord representing their service in Beta Club.</p>
